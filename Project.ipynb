    "The theme of our project is heart disease, and we will be utilizing the data set sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This data encompasses information from four distinct databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and VA Long Beach. Our study will concentrate on the Cleveland data set. This dataset classifies the presence of heart disease in a patient on a scale of 0-4 (0 implying the absence of risk, and 4 indicating the greatest presence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, we are trying to answer the question: What variables can be used to classify a personâ€™s risk of heart disease in Cleveland? Given that the response variable, num, is categorical, we will be solving this as a classification problem. There are a total of 14 different variables provided in the data set that can help detect the level of risk of heart disease in a patient. Please see the bottom of this document for the variable meanings."
